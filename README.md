# Y-Tree-Creator

## About
Y-Tree Creator allows you to automatically generate the entire Y-DNA (or a specific subclade) based on the set of Y-SNPs. Pre-built executables are available in [releases](https://github.com/fiidau/Y-Tree-Creator/releases/latest).

**Usage / Tips:** *Extract the download and place the SNPs as a comma separated value in each file inside the data folder (SNPs format found at FTDNA projects). Execute the Y-Tree Creator executable program and build tree. Then enter the Y-SNPs in the text box and plot it. You can export or save/open the entire generated tree or the SNPs plotted on the new tree as a report. Try with a few files specific to a sub-clade and then go bigger. Currently, the data folder contains  37 files from J-Haplogroup as sample which I took from [J1 Y-DNA Project](https://www.familytreedna.com/public/J-M267/default.aspx?section=ysnp). You can remove them and place your own files or just add it to the existing list of files.*
